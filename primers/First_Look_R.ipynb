    "# A First Look at R\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is intended to provide you with a first look at the R programming language, starting from basic calculations and moving up through a linear regression. \n",

    "If you are unfamiliar with notebooks, please review some basics [here](https://github.com/michhar/useR2016-tutorial-jupyter). \n",

    "## Essential Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "A very brief summary of the critical components and commands within jupyter are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Critically, press `Ctrl+Enter` to run (or render) the current cell.\n",
    "2. Output will print to the notebook. You may have to scroll up to see it all.\n",
    "3. Get help for any function by typing a question mark and then its name into\n",
    "   the console: `?rxLinMod`. It will split the window, and will bring up the documentation for \n",
    "   that function below.\n",
    "5. Files will appear in the specified directory. You can find them by selecting File in the menu bar and selecting \"Open...\". This will open a new browser window with a file navigator.\n",
    "6. R objects can be viewed by typing `ls()` in an R cell.\n",
    "7. Run all the example code!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of hands-on exercises in the document, so while you can run the notebook from beginning to end, you will get a lot more out of it by actually walking through cell-by-cell, and filling out the corresponding exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "These notebooks are based on a tutorial presented at a Microsoft conference in June of 2016. The original files are available [here](https://github.com/joseph-rickert/MLADS_JUNE_2016)\n",
